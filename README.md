# Paguri :house:
House rental web application

### Description
Web application that allows you to rent residences, similar to Airbnb.

An API was developed to interact with the app resources, such as the residences and users.

An interactive map was created, using the Google Maps API, that featured all the residences with icons and allowed you to filter according to various categories.
